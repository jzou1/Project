            Mae’s work stems from her interest in Quantum Mechanics,
            specifically from an idea that consciousness determines objective
            existence. She is exploring this concept through a style caused
            MONO-HA. This creates a discussion how natural objects communicate
            in different spaces. From this concept Mae is interested in how the
            audience look at this communication as well as how objects
            communicate with each other. Mae’s research takes place at the
            seaside shores where she examines the bubbles that form from the sea
            hitting the rocks. To materialize this exchange of energy, Mae will
            create large plastic spheres representation of the bubble. The
            spheres will contain water and a carbon ball separately. The work
            will be interactive as the audience can push and move the spheres,
            to create drawing from the ball. This work will investigate how
            natural elements and people interact with the object and focuses on
            how the audience considering this relationship. Human consciousness
            affects the authenticity of objective facts.
